			<p class="para">For those of us who grew up in villages, mention of cow brings nostalgia. Our dawn was through the cowshed, besides the
			house. Milking cows was a loving early morning ritual for the mothers. Mother would move to the shed with a shining pot,
			lovely stroke the cow on its back, calling it by the name. The milk that the cow spared for the household nourished the
			whole family, especially the children, even like it nurtured its own calf.
			
			The cow is a moving temple, being abode of thirty three crore Gods of the Hindu pantheon. She has given sacred
			Panchagavya with immense medicinal value and is a moving hospital.
			
			Cow is the mother of the universe (Gavo Vishwasya Matharaha). She helps in agriculture, transportation, food, health,
			industry, sports, and religious functions. From time immemorial, cow has a special place in Indian society.
